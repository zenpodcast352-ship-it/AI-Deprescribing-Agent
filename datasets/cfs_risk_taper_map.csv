1,Very Fit,Fit,1.0,1.0,Standard tapering protocols apply. Low risk of withdrawal complications.
2,Well,Fit,1.0,1.0,Standard tapering protocols apply.
3,Managing Well,Fit,1.0,1.0,Standard tapering protocols apply. Monitor for latent symptoms.
4,Vulnerable,Vulnerable,1.25,0.75,Consider extending taper duration by 25%. Monitor for 'unmasking' of symptoms.
5,Mildly Frail,Frail,1.5,0.5,"Physiological reserve is reduced. Cut standard dose reduction steps in half (e.g., reduce by 10% instead of 20%)."
6,Moderately Frail,Frail,1.75,0.5,High risk of withdrawal causing confusion/falls. Use 'Hyperbolic' (very slow) tapering.
7,Severely Frail,Severe Frailty,2.0,0.25,Extreme Caution. Withdrawal stress may precipitate delirium. Extend taper steps to 6-8 weeks.
8,Very Severely Frail,Severe Frailty,2.5,0.25,Approaching end of life. Only deprescribe if medication is causing overt harm. Taper very slowly.
9,Terminally Ill,Terminal,0.0,0.0,"Symptom control is priority. Deprescribing is based on 'Time to Benefit'. If drug provides no symptom relief, stop immediately. If withdrawal causes distress, maintain dose."
